A small React app that demonstrates how to connect a web app to the Midnight Network Wallet via dApp connector API and browser wallet extensions (for example, Lace). Use this as a reference implementation for connecting and interacting with [Midnight dApp Connector APIs](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/midnight-api/dapp-connector).

If you are a developer familiar with React but new to Midnight, you can refer to the [TUTORIAL](https://github.com/bochaco/react-mn-wallet-connect/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md) which will guide you through the basic steps to create a React application that connects to a wallet using the Midnight DApp Connector API.

Built during Midnight Hacktoberfest 2025.
