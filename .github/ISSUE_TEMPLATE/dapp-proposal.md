**Give your dApp a name or working title:**  
 `e.g. Private Journal DApp`

**One-sentence summary of the idea:**  
 `e.g. A decentralized journaling app that encrypts each entry using ZK-proofs, ensuring entries remain private unless selectively disclosed.`

### **🔍 Problem Statement**

**What problem does this solve or what opportunity does it unlock?**  
 `Why does this dApp need to exist? What user pain or need is it addressing?`

### **🌐 Target Users**

**Who would use this dApp?**  
 `e.g. Journalers, whistleblowers, regulated industries, researchers`

**How would they benefit from Midnight’s data-protection features?**

### **🔧 Core Functionality**

**What are the key features or actions users would take in the app?**

* `Write and edit entries`

* `Prove authorship without revealing content`

* `Share entries with a specific recipient`

### **🔐 Privacy & ZK Usage**

**How would you leverage Midnight’s privacy features or zero-knowledge technology?**  
 `e.g. Entries stored privately with selective disclosure proofs.`

### **📦 Technical Considerations**

**Do you have a preferred tech stack or prior implementation?**  
 `e.g. React frontend, Midnight smart contracts using Compact.`

**Any integrations or infrastructure required?**  
 `e.g. IPFS, identity wallet, oracle, etc.`
